# Sorting-and-Searching-Application

The project brief required an searching an sorting application to be designed and implemented. In particular, the appliaction 
was to be designed as a Console Application, which will help with the analysis of seismic Data.

A set of files is provided, the files correspond to real Seismic Data taken from two regions from the Incorporated Research
Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) repository. The files correspond to the Year, Month, Day, Time (UTC), Magnitude, Latitude, Longitude,
Depth (km), Region, IRIS ID, and IRIS Timestamp of seismic data, respectively.

The Console Application is be able to provide the following functionality to the user:

1. Select which individual Array or String Array is to be analysed.
2. Sort in ascending or descending order and display the selected Array or String Array. 
3. Search according to the content of the provided files.
4. Search according to the content of the Month, and display ALL the corresponding values of the files.
5. When sorting in ascending or descending order the Month file you should display the months as they appear during the calendar year (i.e. in ascending order they should be: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December).
6. Find the minimum and maximum values of of the data in the files. Displays ALL the corresponding values of the remaining files data.

A comparative evaluation for the all the searching and sorting tasks by using different Searching or Sorting algorithms. Displays the number of steps that each algorithm performed. No built-in sorting and searching functions of the compiler are used.
